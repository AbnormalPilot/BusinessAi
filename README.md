# BusinessAi Landing Page Setup Guide

The source code for your landing page has been successfully generated! 
Since the code was generated without an active internet connection, you will notice "Cannot find module" errors in your editor. This is normal.

## 🚀 How to Fix the Errors & Start the App

Follow these steps once you have an internet connection:

1.  **Open Terminal**:
    Ensure you are in the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/bhabanisankarpradhan/NstHack/BusinessAi
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Run this command to install React, Next.js, and other required packages. This will fix all the red errors in your files.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start Development Server**:
    Launch the app to see your new landing page!
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser**:
    Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `app/page.tsx`: The main landing page composed of all sections.
- `components/`: Contains all the UI blocks (Hero, Features, Pricing, etc.).
- `app/globals.css`: Contains your global styles and color variables.
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration for colors and animations.
